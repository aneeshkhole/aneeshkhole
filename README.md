# ANEESH KHOLE - 🔍 Data Detective

Welcome to the GitHub portfolio of a **Data Detective**! I'm a data science enthusiast with a knack for uncovering hidden insights and solving complex problems. Like a detective, I analyze data, find patterns, and derive actionable conclusions to help businesses make informed decisions.

## 🕵️ About Me

- **Name:** Aneesh Khole
- **Role:**
  - Graduate Researcher at the Animal Inspired Movement and Robotics Lab, University of Colorado Boulder
  - Student Assistant at the Data Science department, University of Colorado Boulder
            
- **Background:** Computer Engineering, Data Science, Robotics, Machine Learning

I have a strong foundation in data science and machine learning, with a unique twist - I apply these skills in the fascinating field of animal-inspired robotics. My work involves not just crunching numbers but also understanding and mimicking the natural world.

## 🧰 My Detective Toolbox

Here are some of the tools and languages I use to solve data mysteries:

- **Programming Languages:** Python, R
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, SciPy
- **Data Wrangling:** SQL, BeautifulSoup, Regular Expressions, MS Excel, MS Access
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## 🔎 Case Studies

Here are some "cases" I've solved as a Data Detective:

<!--1. **[Mystery of the Missing Data](https://github.com/yourusername/project-link)**  
   Solved a complex data imputation problem, filling missing values in large datasets using advanced statistical techniques.

2. **[Pattern in the Noise](https://github.com/yourusername/project-link)**  
   Developed a machine learning model that detects anomalies in sensor data collected from animal-inspired robots.-->

1. **[The Curious Case of Useful Customer Reviews](https://github.com/aneeshkhole/Perceived-Usefulness-of-online-customer-reviews)**  
   Applied clustering algorithms to segment customers for a retail business, optimizing marketing strategies and improving sales.

## 🧩 Ongoing Investigations

I'm always looking for new data mysteries to solve. Currently, I'm investigating:

- **Movement Patterns in Spiders:** Understanding how spiders move and behave to create more efficient robots.
